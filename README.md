For my first Godot project, Scarlet Shadow, I built a small movement tester that was inspired by
<a href="https://dawnosaur.itch.io/platformer-movement-demo-2">DawnosaurDev</a> and was aimed at helping to find the best-fitting movement for the player character.

I added all the typical settings, such as coyote time, and made them adjustable. This made it easy to find the best-fitting movement and it was also interesting to see how everyone had a different idea of “perfect” movement.

It’s a small project, but it combines my love for good-feeling gameplay with the “procedural” aspect of changing and experimenting with settings until they match your ideal vision.
